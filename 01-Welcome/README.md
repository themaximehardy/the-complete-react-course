### 1. Why Should I Learn React?

There are two main reasons: (1) the **React library itself** and (2) the **React community**.

1. **React library itself**

React has a **small learning curve**. We can get up and running with the fundamentals of React very quickly.

The core of React is this idea of **components**. You have components on your page for things like a login form or the application header. You put multiple components together and you end up with a complete application. Component based architecture forces you to take complex applications and break them up into small little contained pieces (much easier to build, maintain, test and debug).

React is really **fast**! It renders and re-renders your application quickly keeping it up to date with the latest changes in your application data.

With React, you are not just learning something that can be useful to build web applications... You can build **mobile applications**, **desktop apps**, **virtual reality apps** and more!

In summary, we can write **complex applications without complex code** and react as **fast** allowing us to build applications for a **wide range of platforms**.

2. **React community**

You're joining an **active community of developers**, companies jobs and open source projects with a strong community. There is also **a lot of tools and libraries** which already exist to help you achieve what you want.
